Current such “meta-optimizers” often learn in the space of continuous optimization algorithms that are point-based and uncertainty- unaware. To overcome the limitations, we propose a meta-optimizer that learns in the algorithmic space of both point-based and population-based optimization algorithms. The meta-optimizer targets at a meta-loss function consisting of both cumulative regret and entropy. Specifically, we learn and interpret the update formula through a population of LSTMs embedded with sample- and feature-level attentions. Meanwhile, we estimate the posterior directly over the global optimum and use an uncertainty measure to help guide the learning process. Empirical results over non-convex test functions and the protein-docking application demonstrate that this new meta-optimizer outperforms existing competitors.

However, the learned “attentive” features are often not naturally uncorrelated or “diverse”, which compromises the retrieval performance based on the Euclidean distance. We advocate the com- plementary powers of attention and diversity for Re-ID, by proposing an Attentive but Diverse Network (ABD-Net). ABD-Net seamlessly integrates attention modules and diversity regularizations throughout the entire network to learn features that are representative, robust, and more dis- criminative. Specifically, we introduce a pair of comple- mentary attention modules, focusing on channel aggregation and position awareness, respectively. Then, we plug in a novel orthogonality constraint that efficiently enforces di- versity on both hidden activations and weights. Through an extensive set of ablation study, we verify that the attentive and diverse terms each contributes to the perfor- mance boosts of ABD-Net. It consistently outperforms exist- ing state-of-the-art methods on there popular person Re-ID benchmarks.","categories":[{"name":"ICCV'19","slug":"ICCV-19","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/categories/ICCV-19/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Person Re-Identification","slug":"Person-Re-Identification","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/tags/Person-Re-Identification/"}]},{"title":"(ICCVW 2019) Cross-Model Person Search, A Coarse-to-FineFramework using Bi-directional Text-Image Matching","slug":"ICCVW19","date":"2019-10-26T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-07-22T02:05:48.743Z","comments":true,"path":"ICCVW19/","link":"","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/ICCVW19/","excerpt":"","text":"Cross-Model Person Search: A Coarse-to-FineFramework using Bi-directional Text-Image Matching[Paper] AbstractSearching person images from a gallery based on natu- ral language descriptions remains to be a challenging and under-explored cross-modal retrieval problem. To improve the accuracy off an image-based retrieval task, e.g., person re-identification (Person Re-Id), re-ranking is known to be an effective post-processing tool. In this paper, we extend re-ranking from uni-modal retrieval to cross-modal retrieval for the first time, and develop a bi-directional coarse-to-fine framework (BCF) for cross-modal person search. Built on a recent state-of-the-art Person Re- Id model , BCF exploits first text-to-image and then image-to-text relevance, in a two-stage refinement fash- ion. BCF ranks competitively against a strong baseline on the newly-introduced WIDER Person Search dataset , boosting validation set performance by 9.01% (top-1) / 3.87 % (mAP) for val1 and 6.60% (top-1) / 3.49% (mAP) for val2, respectively. With a high score, our solution ranks competitively in the ICCV 2019 WIDER Person Search by Language Challenge.","categories":[{"name":"ICCVW'19","slug":"ICCVW-19","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/categories/ICCVW-19/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Person Re-Identification","slug":"Person-Re-Identification","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/tags/Person-Re-Identification/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"NeurIPS'19","slug":"NeurIPS-19","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/categories/NeurIPS-19/"},{"name":"ICCV'19","slug":"ICCV-19","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/categories/ICCV-19/"},{"name":"ICCVW'19","slug":"ICCVW-19","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/categories/ICCVW-19/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Learning to Optimize","slug":"Learning-to-Optimize","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/tags/Learning-to-Optimize/"},{"name":"Person Re-Identification","slug":"Person-Re-Identification","permalink":"https://tianlong-chen.github.io/tags/Person-Re-Identification/"}]}
